Attorney General Harry Daugherty was investigated for accepting bribes from a German agent seeking to buy a German-owned company that had been seized by the U.S. government during World War I.
Daugherty refused to open Justice Department files to a congressional committee.
He also refused to testify under oath, claiming immunity, or freedom from prosecution, on the grounds that he had had confidential dealings with President Harding.
Daugherty was later dismissed by President Coolidge.

Teapot Dome and the other scandals of the Harding administration increased Americans' distrust of the federal government and political leaders.
This distrust added to the growing frustration with progressive policies caused by World War I.
Many progressive ideas depended on efficient, honest government to be effective.
If the government was corrupt, it helped make the case for reducing the role of government in the economy.
