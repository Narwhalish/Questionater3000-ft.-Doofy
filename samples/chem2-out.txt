mole ratio Reaction stoichiometry involves the mass relationships between reactants  and products in a chemical reaction.
Relating one substance to another requires expressing the amount of each  substance in moles.
A mole ratio is the conversion factor that relates the amount in moles of any  two substances in a chemical reaction.
The mole ratio is derived from the  balanced equation.
Amount of a substance is expressed in moles, and mass of a substance is  expressed by using mass units such as grams, kilograms, or milligrams.
 Mass and amount of substance are quantities, whereas moles and grams  are units.
A balanced chemical equation is necessary to solve any stoichiometric  SecTIon 2  Ideal Stoichiometric calculations In an ideal stoichiometric calculation, the mass or the amount of any  reactant or product can be calculated if the balanced chemical equation  and the mass or amount of any other reactant or product is known.
SecTIon 3  Limiting Reactants and Percentage yield In actual reactions, the reactants may be present in proportions that differ  from the stoichiometric proportions required for a complete reaction in  which all of each reactant is converted to product.
The limiting reactant controls the maximum possible amount of product  For many reactions, the quantity of a product is less than the theoretical  maximum for that product.
Percentage yield shows the relationship   between the theoretical yield and actual yield for the product of a reaction.
limiting reactant  excess reactant theoretical yield actual yield percentage yield.
