Reaction stoichiometry involves the mass relationships between reactants 
and products in a chemical reaction.
Relating one substance to another requires expressing the amount of each 
substance in moles.
A mole ratio is the conversion factor that relates the amount in moles of any 
two substances in a chemical reaction. The mole ratio is derived from the 
balanced equation.
Amount of a substance is expressed in moles, and mass of a substance is 
expressed by using mass units such as grams, kilograms, or milligrams. 
Mass and amount of substance are quantities, whereas moles and grams 
are units.
A balanced chemical equation is necessary to solve any stoichiometric 
problem.

SecTIon 2  Ideal Stoichiometric calculations

• 

In an ideal stoichiometric calculation, the mass or the amount of any 
reactant or product can be calculated if the balanced chemical equation 
and the mass or amount of any other reactant or product is known.

SecTIon 3  Limiting Reactants and Percentage yield

Key TeRMS

• 

• 

In actual reactions, the reactants may be present in proportions that differ 
from the stoichiometric proportions required for a complete reaction in 
which all of each reactant is converted to product.
The limiting reactant controls the maximum possible amount of product 
formed.
For many reactions, the quantity of a product is less than the theoretical 
maximum for that product. Percentage yield shows the relationship  
between the theoretical yield and actual yield for the product of a reaction.
