have spoken sharply but kindly, for they were substantial people
who knew the conditions of life for a woman and loved their
daughter—indeed, more likely than not she was the apple of
her father’s eye. Perhaps she scribbled some pages up in an apple
loft on the sly, but was careful to hide them or set fire to them.
Soon, however, before she was out of her teens, she was to be
betrothed to the son of a neighboring wool stapler.2 She cried
out that marriage was hateful to her, and for that she was severely
beaten by her father. Then he ceased to scold her. He begged her
instead not to hurt him, not to shame him in this matter of her
marriage. He would give her a chain of beads or a fine petticoat,
he said; and there were tears in his eyes. How could she disobey
him? How could she break his heart? The force of her own gift
alone drove her to it. She made up a small parcel of her belong-
ings, let herself down by a rope one summer’s night, and took
the road to London. She was not seventeen. The birds that sang
in the hedge were not more musical than she was. She had the
quickest fancy, a gift like her brother’s, for the tune of words.
Like him, she had a taste for the theater. She stood at the stage
door; she wanted to act, she said. Men laughed in her face. The
manager—a fat, loose-lipped man—guffawed. He bellowed
something about poodles dancing and women acting—no
woman, he said, could possibly be an actress. He hinted—you
can imagine what. She could get no training in her craft. Could
she even seek her dinner in a tavern or roam the streets at mid-
night? Yet her genius was for fiction and lusted to feed abun-
dantly upon the lives of men and women and the study of their
ways. At last—for she was very young, oddly like Shakespeare
the poet in her face, with the same gray eyes and rounded
brows—at last Nick Greene the actor-manager took pity on her;
she found herself with child by that gentleman and so—who
shall measure the heat and violence of the poet’s heart when
caught and tangled in a woman’s body?—killed herself one
