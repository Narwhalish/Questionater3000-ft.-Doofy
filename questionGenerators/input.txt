O Captain.
My Captain.
O Captain.
My Captain.
Our fearful trip is done.
The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won.
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting.
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring.
But O heart.
Heart.
Heart.
O the bleeding drops of red.
Where on the deck my captain lies, fallen cold and dead.
O Captain.
My Captain.
Rise up and hear the bells.
Rise up for you the flag is flung, for you the bugle trills.
For you the bouquets and wreaths, for you the shores a-crowding.
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning.
O Captain.
Dear father.
This arm beneath your head.
It is some dream that on the deck, youâ€™ve fallen cold and dead.
My captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still.
My father does not feel my arm; he has no pulse nor will.
The ship is safe and sound, its voyage closed and done.
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won.
Exult, O shores.
And ring, O bells.
But I, with silent tread, walk the spot my captain lies, fallen cold and dead.
